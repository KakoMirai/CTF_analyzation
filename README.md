# CTF_analyzation
Analyzation of public capture the flag pentesting environment in the eyes of a corporations cybersec management.

### Our goal
Our goal is to analyze one or more public capture the flag type pentesting environments in the eyes of managing cyber security. We will map the vulnerabilities and analyze why they exist and how they could affect the management of cybersecurity in real life situations.

If possible we will write report on how the vulnerability works and how it could be prevented in perspective of cybersecurity management. This project is a short project and it is done for our course in Haaga-Helia UAS. There are 2 participants and each will work for around 50 hours for the project. Most of the time will be used to map out the vulnerabilities and to exploit them.
